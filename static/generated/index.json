    "prompt": "Candid photograph of a confident startup founder in a modern, converted office space, mid-celebration with a small team. The scene is documentary-style: natural light streaming from large windows, early morning or late evening ambiance. The founder is visibly energizedâ€”subtle smile, upright posture, surrounded by evidence of recent hard work: scattered coffee cups, notebooks, and personal items. The environment feels lived-in and urgent, with industrial elements and a cool-neutral color base. Electric orange accents appear naturally in clothing or objects. The image features high contrast between light and shadow, selective focus highlighting the founder, with the team in the background sharing the moment. Subtle film grain and tactile texture add authenticity, capturing the intensity and relief of a breakthrough moment without forced poses or corporate polish.",
